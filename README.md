# BGSM: Beginners Github Search Manager
Helps beginners to search and contribute to open source projects with github

Our goal: to find and manage projects friendly to beginners.

BGSM filters search list from projects for which user already has made
a Pull Request and from projects he/she is currently working on and also
from projects user doesn't want to contribute to (not visible in search list).

When user clicks 'In Work' button the issue is added to 'issues in work' box.
In this box user has two clickable buttons: 'PR' and 'DEL'.
If 'PR' is clicked then issue is moved from 'issues in work' to 'PR-ed issues'.
If 'DEL' is clicked then issue is just deleted from 'issues in work' and
doesn't appear in search list again.
