Helps beginners to search and contribute to open source projects with github

I think many beginners want to try some real world programming. And one of the best ways is contributing to an open source project. 
Well, I'm just exact that type of beginner and I've found out soon that it's not an easy task to find a project where you can realy help.
Most of the projects look much not like single page applications we're used to. There many files you even don't understand why they are
needed. And when you get digging into files you find that they don't have start and finish. They have some pieces of code that some
other files use. And many other frustrating things can happing in beginners way. 
But there're still projects with issues labled as `up-for-grabs`, `good first bug`, `easy`, `help wanted` and others of that sort.
So that's our goal: to find projects like that and try to give a hand. And after you digg into a project you either make a PR or leave
that issue alone. You probably don't want to get back to that issue again in any case. So the BGSM is going to have fitures like that. 
After you decided to work with an issue it won't appear in search results anymore. And many other good and handy fitures are waiting
to be added to the project. It's going to be a helpfull issue manager for beginners.
